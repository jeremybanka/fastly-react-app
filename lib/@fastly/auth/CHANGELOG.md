# CHANGELOG

## v4.3.3
- updates permission set to match IAM service
## v4.3.2
- Bug fix to correct customer data in mirage (for Tango)

## v4.3.1
- Adds additional safegaurds for internal permission checks
- adds an internal legacy role check for internal users

## v4.3.0
- Phase 2 for the Permissions service
- This introduces the ability to check permissions against new eRBAC permissions while allowing for a fallback to legacy RBAC checks

## v4.2.0
- Phase 1 for the Permissions service, `permitted` helper, and the `not-permitted` helper.
- This phase introduces a path for removing direct calls to Ember Can by placing our new service and helpers between our code and Ember Can.
- This adds the logical break between our old RBAC implementation (legacy RBAC) and Enhanced RBAC (eRBAC) but stops just short of implementing the new eRBAC systems which will come in the next phase of this work.

- ## v4.1.2
- Improve the user group factory for testing purposes

## v4.1.1
- Adds support for query params on GET /user-groups mock endpoint

## v3.0.0
* GET /accounts-authorizations is now POST /account-authorizations.

**Breaking change**: consuming applications must update their mirage configs in order to switch accounts in mirage-mode.

```
// mirage/config.js

// change
this.get(`${API_ORIGIN}/account-authorizations`)
// to
this.post(`${API_ORIGIN}/account-authorizations`)
```

## v2.15.2
* Stops removing the current token when attempting switch to SAML account to address bug with disappearing tokens on switch to SAML

  - The active token in use will be stored in sessionStorage. This will allow a person to be logged in to multiple customers across multiple tabs at the same time.
* Adds routes and templates to support 2 customer switching flows:
  - customer switching interrupted by the need to 2FA
  - customer switching initiated at the account menu

  session exists. Fixes [APPENG-1211](https://jira.corp.fastly.com/browse/APPENG-1211)

## v2.4.0

* Add optional support for [ember-feature-flags](https://github.com/kategengler/ember-feature-flags)
